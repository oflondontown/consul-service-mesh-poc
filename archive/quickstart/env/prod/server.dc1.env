## Quickstart: dc1 Consul server VM
##
## Update these IPs for your environment.

CONSUL_DATACENTER=dc1

# The IP of THIS server VM, reachable by:
# - app VMs in the same DC (LAN gossip/client RPC)
# - the other DC's mesh gateway (WAN federation + data plane)
HOST_IP=192.168.1.2

# MVP: 1 server per DC. For production, use 3 servers per DC and set this to 3.
CONSUL_BOOTSTRAP_EXPECT=1

# LAN peers (servers in this DC). With 1 server, it's just itself.
CONSUL_RETRY_JOIN=192.168.1.2

# WAN federation peers (servers in the other DC). With 1 server in dc2, it's that server IP.
CONSUL_RETRY_JOIN_WAN=10.0.1.21

# Optional (Consul UI/HTTP API is bound to 127.0.0.1 by the Podman pod port mapping)
CONSUL_ENABLE_UI=1

# Optional: host-side bind address for Consul UI/API and gRPC.
# Default is 127.0.0.1 (local-only). For remote access set to 0.0.0.0 or a specific host IP.
# MGMT_BIND_ADDR=0.0.0.0

# Envoy image/flags
# (Set explicitly so your shell environment can't accidentally override it.)
