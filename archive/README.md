# Archive

This folder contains **deprecated** run modes and reference configurations that are no longer part of the supported path.

Supported path (keep your focus here):

- `config/mesh.yml` (copy from `config/mesh.example.yml`)
- Deploy-time: `tools/render-mesh-bundles.py` -> `run/mesh/bundles/*.bundle.json`
- Runtime start/stop: `scripts/prod/meshctl-*.sh` (calls `tools/meshctl.py`)
- Runbook: `docs/production-runbook.md`

Everything under `archive/` is kept only for historical reference and can be deleted if you don’t need it.
